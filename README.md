# graphics-compression
This repository provides tools for compressing vector graphics, specifically designed for scientific applications using Python. The approach reduces data while preserving the visual integrity of the graphics.

Folder Structure

--- time_complexity_analysis:

This folder contains scripts for analyzing the time complexity of graph compression:

plots_time_complexity.py – Generates plots for experimental data analysis.

graphs_compression_time.py – Compresses each graph, measures compression time based on the number of points, and saves the results in a text file.

time_complexity_fits.py – Performs and visualizes linear fits to the experimental data.

--- programs_to_use:

This folder contains two scripts for compressing graphs:

graphs_compression_file.py – Compresses a single SVG plot with data points, using a background-only version (frame, labels, etc.) as a reference.

graphs_compression_directory.py – Compresses all SVG files in a directory that share the same background, using a reference SVG file without data points.
